# About

Little Golang projects for training. The idea of this repo is to solve exercises using Go. You can find here implementations of data structures and algorithms used to solve exercises.

Some of data structures and algorithms here:

- Red Black Tree
- Algorithm to create the combinations of elements in an array.
- Algorithm to create the permutations with repetition of elements in an array.
- Algorithm to create the permutation without repetition of elements in an array.
- Ordered binary tree.
- Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- Deep First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- Linked list implementation.
- Topological Sort algorithm.
- Backtracking implementation of Lee algorithm.

# Requirements
go 1.16

# How to execute
