The square of a directed graph G=(V,E) is the graph G^2=(V, E^2) such that
(u,v)e E^2 if and only G contains a path with at most two edges between u and v.
Describe efficient algorithms for computing G^2 from G for both the adjacency-
list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your
algorithms.
