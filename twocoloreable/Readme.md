There are two types of professional wrestlers: “babyfaces” (“good guys”) and
“heels” (“bad guys”). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or
may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have n professional wrestlers and we have a list
of r pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an O(n+r) time algo-
rithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as
babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a babyface
and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should
produce it.
